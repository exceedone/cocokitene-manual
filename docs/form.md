If there is an item in the form that selects data from another table, you can copy the contents of the selected data to another related item.  
Ex: When "Customer" is selected in the "Contract" form, the value of "Customer Name" in the "Customer" data is copied to "Customer Name" in the "Contract" form.

## Related refinement settings
When the column type is "Select (from table)", "User", or "Organization", the choice is narrowed down according to the selection of another item in the same form. It can be set only when the columns of the parent table or referenced table of the target table exist in the same form.  

#### Example
1:n relationship is set in the "Customer Information" table and the "Contact Information" table, and the "Customer" column and the "Contact Information" column exist in the "Contract Information" table.  
When selecting the "Customer" column, I want to narrow down the options in the "Person in charge" column to only the person in charge whose parent is the selected "Customer".  

![Custom form page](img/form/relation_filter1.png)  

There is the following data,
![Custom form page](img/form/relation_filter2.png)  

On the contract information page,
![Custom form page](img/form/relation_filter3.png) 

After selecting "A Co., Ltd." in "Customer", select the person in charge belonging to A Co., Ltd. as an option candidate.
![Custom form page](img/form/relation_filter4.png)

#### Procedure

In the form item, click the settings icon in the Contact column.  
![Custom form page](img/form/relation_filter6.png)

- In the dialog that opens, there is an item for "Related refinement settings".
The choices you see are a list of columns that are the parent of the selected column in the same form.
In this example, the Customer table column, which is the parent table of the Contact table, is displayed in the choices.  
\* The "Related refinement setting" button is displayed when the custom column is "Select (from table)", "User", and "Organization".
![Custom form page](img/form/relation_filter7.png)

- After setting, click the "Set" button.  


#### Specifications less than v3.3.1
<span class="small">In v3.3.1 or less, this setting screen was not displayed, and the choices were narrowed down in all fields with 1: n parent-child relationship / reference relationship.  
As a result, sometimes it caused unnecessary narrowing down and unexpected problems, so in v3.3.1, we added a setting so that you can select whether or not to narrow down.  
When updating from less than v3.3.1 to v3.3.1 or higher, in order to maintain compatibility, the setting "narrow down the options in all fields with 1: n parent-child relationship / reference relationship" is inherited. I will.  
Click [here](/patch/relation_filter) for details on the specifications at the time of update.</span>
