## Server construction
If you haven't built the server yet, build a web server or database server.  
Please check [here](/server) for the construction method.

### Web server construction
Exment requires PHP 7.3.0.  
If you have not built the server yet, please check [here](/server) and build it.

### Introduced composer
Exment requires composer to be installed on the web server.  
Please refer to here for the installation method.  
※Those who have already installed it are not required.  
- [Official site](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
- [Windows version commentary site](https://weblabo.oscasierra.net/php-composer-windows-install/)
- [Linux version commentary site](https://weblabo.oscasierra.net/php-composer-centos-install/)
- [Mac version commentary site](https://weblabo.oscasierra.net/php-composer-macos-homebrew-install/)


### Database construction
Exment's database engine requires one of the following:

- MySQL 5.7.8 or higher and less than 8.0.0
- MariaDB 10.2.7 and above
- SQL Server 13.0.0 or higher (Currently, automatic backup・restore is not supported)

If you have not set up the database server yet, please check [here](/server #database) and build it.


## Exment app settings
After the server construction is completed, set the application of Exment.

### zip Download / Extract
- Download the zip file from the following URL.
[Exment zip file] (https://exment.net/downloads/ja/exment.zip)

- Extract the zip file to a PHP executable path.
Example 1 (XAMPP Windows): C: \ xampp \ local \ extension
Example 2 (XAMPP Mac): / Applications / XAMPP / local / extension
Example 3 (XServer): $ HOME / domain.com.foobar/exment/
  
- <span class = "red bold"> Do not put the zip file directly under the public folder of each server (eg linux: / var / www / html). Installation files containing database settings and email passwords will be disclosed to the outside, leading to fatal information leakage. </span>
