# Update procedure v1.0.X → v1.1.X
Updating from version1.0.X to version1.1.X requires some special steps.  
This section describes the procedure for updating from version1.0.X to version1.1.X.  
※ This step is not required when newly installing version1.1.X. Install from the usual [Installation procedure](/quickstart). 

## Procedure

#### Update to v1.0.12
If your version of Exment is v1.0.11 or lower, first update Exment to v1.0.12.  

~~~
composer require exceedone/exment=1.0.12
php artisan exment:update
~~~


#### Backup
Log in to Exment with an administrator account, and back up the current environment from "Backup" in the menu.  
Please check [Backup](/backup) for details.  
Then, download it.  


#### Upgrade to v1.1.X
Execute the following command to update Exment to v1.1.X.

~~~
composer require exceedone/exment
php artisan exment:update
~~~


#### Delete encore / laravel-admin, clear cache
Delete the package "[encore / laravel-admin](https://github.com/z-song/laravel-admin)".  
※From v1.1.0, the direction has been changed to "exceedone / laravel-admin", which is a fork of the MIT license "encore / laravel-admin".  
This makes it possible to display site subdirectories.  
However, when updating from v1.0.X to v1.1.X, the above libraries are not deleted automatically, so you need to delete them manually by this procedure.  

~~~
composer remove encore/laravel-admin
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan route:clear
php artisan view:clear
~~~

#### exment: update execution

~~~
php artisan exment:update
~~~


#### Add error page display logic
We have added error page display logic when an error occurs.  
Perform [Installation procedure # Add error page](/quickstart#Add-error-page) .  


#### Update completed
This completes the update process.
