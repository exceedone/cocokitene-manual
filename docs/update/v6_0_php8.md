# Update procedure v6.0.0
In Exment v6.0.0, the supported version of PHP will change.   
Before v6.0.0, we used PHP8.0, but as the security support period for PHP8.0 ended in November 2023, we will change to PHP8.2 or higher.   
Additionally, in order to minimize future PHP/Laravel version changes as much as possible, we have decided to change the Laravel version to Laravel 10, which is currently the latest version.   
MySQL has also been changed to MySQL 8.0, which is the latest version at this stage.

## How to upgrade MySQL version MySQL8.0

The previous MySQL version was 5.7 at most, but from now on it will be MySQL 8.0. As a result, all users will need to update to MySQL 8.0.   
For the update procedure, please check [here](/install_mysql).

## MariaDB version upgrade method MariaDB 10.4
If you are using MariaDB 10.4 or lower, you need to update to MariaDB 10.4.
### Update work for XAMPP environment
- Before proceeding, stop MariaDB and close the XAMPP control panel.   
- Rename mysql folder. (Example: Change the default name C:\xampp\mysql to C:\xampp\mysql-old)
- Download the new MariaDB in ZIP format.

   1. Access [MariaDB Download](https://mariadb.org/download/?t=mariadb&p=mariadb&r=10.4.33&os=windows&cpu=x86_64&pkg=zip)
   2. Download the file according to the OS and MariaDB version you want to use.   
      > Please select the zip file instead of the MSI.
   3. Unzip the ZIP file, change the unzipped folder name to mysql, and move to the XAMPP folder.
- Move mysql-old\data to the mysql folder.
- Move mysql-old\data\php.ini to the mysql\bin folder.
- Click Start in the Apache and MySQL row.

## How to update PHP version PHP8.2

Previously, the maximum PHP version was 8.0, but from now on it will be PHP 8.2 or higher. As a result, all users will need to update to PHP 8.2 or higher.
