find / -name kdevtmpfsi
find / -name kinsing
# Example
/var/lib/docker/overlay2/afab93b1a...74902e08061140e/diff/tmp/kdevtmpfsi
/var/lib/docker/overlay2/afab93b1...a1eb129902e08061140e/merged/tmp/kdevtmpfsi
/var/lib/docker/overlay2/afab93b1a2...742e08061140e/diff/tmp/kinsing
/var/lib/docker/overlay2/afab93...750902e08061140e/merged/tmp/kinsing
# If a file like the one above exists, delete the file
```


### Fundamental solution
This is the root solution for this vulnerability. Please do one of the following: 

- If the whole project (including Extent) can be uploaded: 1
- If for some reason you can't upload the whole project (e.g. you want to keep the Exment version): 2

#### Fundamental workaround 1: Update the entire project
Please update the whole Exment project by the following method.  

- Execute the following command.

```
composer update
```

- Open the "composer.lock" file and search for the string "facade/ignition".  
Check if "facade/ignition", which is the cause of the vulnerability, is 1.16.15 or higher.

```
# Description example
        {
            "name": "facade/ignition",
            "version": "1.16.15", // Make sure this version is 1.16.15 or higher
            "source": {
                "type": "git",
                "url": "https://github.com/facade/ignition.git",

            },
            ... Omitted below
        },
```


- Open the ".env" file, modify the following description, and turn off the debug mode.

```
# Before
APP_DEBUG=true
# After
APP_DEBUG=false
```

#### Fundamental solution 2: Update package facade/ignition
Please update the package facade/ignition that is the target of this vulnerability.

- Execute the following command.

```
composer require facade/ignition=~1.16
```
