#### Memory usage limit
The upper limit of memory usage allocated to run PHP.  
Please check [here](/additional_php_ini) for how to change the settings.

In addition, the "Update from screen" function added from v4.1.0 requires that this composer be installed normally.  
\* A warning may be displayed even though composer is actually installed. This is because the composer path is not passed by the user who runs the web server, or the authority is insufficient.  
If composer is successfully installed and can be run by the user who actually performs the update, ignore this warning.  
\* In order to pass through the composer, please verify [here](/troubleshooting#To-pass-the-composer-path) "To pass the composer path".



#### Backup / Restore
Confirm that the server settings for executing backup / restore are complete.   
\* If you made an error, please check [here](/troubleshooting) the "fail to backup and restore".
