## How to make

### Create config.json
- Create the following config.json file.

~~~ json
{
    "plugin_name": "PluginDemoEvent",
    "uuid": "fa7de170-992a-11e8-b568-0800200c9a66",
    "plugin_view_name": "Plugin Event",
    "description": "A test to execute a plugin event.",,
    "author": "(Your Name)",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "plugin_type": "event",
    "event_triggers": "loaded",

}
~~~

- Enter plugin_name in half-width alphanumeric characters.
- uuid is a string of 32 characters + hyphen, for a total of 36 characters. Used to make the plugin unique.
Please create from the following URL.
https://www.famkruithof.net/uuid/uuidgen
- Enter event for plugin_type.
- When specifying event_triggers from the beginning, enter the names of "trigger types" separated by commas.
- When specifying target_tables from the beginning, enter the table names of the custom table separated by commas.


### PHP file creation
- Create a PHP file like the one below. Name it "Plugin.php".

~~~ php
<? php
namespace App \ Plugins \ PluginDemoEvent;

use Exceedone \ Exment \ Services \ Plugin \ PluginEventBase;
class Plugin extends PluginEventBase
{
    / **
     * Plugin Trigger
     * /
    public function execute ()
    {
        \ Log :: debug ('Event called!');
        return true;
    }
}
~~~
- The namespace should be ** App \ Plugins \\ (Pascal case of plugin name) **. [Click here for details](/plugin_quickstart#plugin-name-namespace)

- If the trigger conditions registered on the plugin management screen are met, the plugin will be called and the execute function in Plugin.php will be executed.

- The Plugin class inherits from the class PluginEventBase.  
PluginEventBase owns properties such as the calling custom table $ custom_table, table value $ custom_value, etc.  
A value is assigned to that property when the execute function is called.  
For more information on properties, see Plugin Reference (plugin_reference.md).

### Compress to zip
Compress the above two files into a zip with the minimum configuration.  
The zip file name should be "(plugin_name) .zip".  
- PluginDemoEvent.zip
    - config.json
    - Plugin.php
    - (Other necessary PHP files, image files, etc.)


### Sample plugin
[External database linkage](https://github.com/exment-git/plugin-sample/tree/main/event/PluginSyncCity)  
- This is a sample that links with an external database when custom data is saved.  
- If you add / update / delete in the city table of Exment, it will be reflected in the city table of the external database.  
- As a preliminary preparation, perform the following processing.
    1. Import [Template](https://exment.net/downloads/sample/template/city_template.zip) from Exment menu "Administrator Settings" → "Templates".  
    - Create an external database. This plug-in uses the MySQL sample database "world".Download the zip from [the Official website](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-other.html) and execute the unzipped SQL in your MySQL (or MariaDB) console.

    - Upload [Plugins](https://github.com/exment-git/plugin-sample/tree/main/event/PluginSyncCity) from Exment menu "Administrator Settings" → "Plugins".  
    - Open the plugin setting page, fill the connection information of the external database (set in 2.) and save.
