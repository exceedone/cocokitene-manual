# Environment construction using Windows Server
This page describes the steps to build Exment on IIS on Windows Server.   
This is a completely new installation procedure, including the installation of the web server.

## Environment
This page is constructed with the following contents.   
- Windows Server 2019 Standard Japanese version
- IIS 10
- PHP 8.2.X
- MySQL 8.0.35

Appropriate notes are provided if Windows 10 is used for verification purposes.

## Important point

- Depending on your environment and version, you may not be able to set up correctly using this procedure. note that.

- This procedure describes only the steps to run Exment on Windows Server.   
General IT knowledge such as Windows Server management, database creation, commands, etc. is not included. note that.   

- **Administrator privileges are required to perform this procedure. If necessary, run the command prompt, PowerShell, or the executable file as administrator (or elevate using User Account Control)**

## Installation instructions using Windows Server

> Before you begin, we recommend that you configure Windows Server Explorer to display   filename extension  

### Installing the web server (IIS)
If the IIS feature is not enabled on your server, first install the IIS feature.
1. Open the Add Roles and Features wizard from Administration in Server Manager  
   ![Add roles and functions](img/iis/iis_s01.png)
2. For Installation type, select Role-based or Feature-based installation, and Server Selection is the server on which you want to install IIS (usually the server you are working on). Select and proceed.
3. Under \[Server Roles\], select   Web Server (IIS)   and also add the displayed features  
   ![Adding a web server](img/iis/iis_s02.png)
4. Proceed to the next screen of \[Feature Selection\] and \[Web Server Role (IIS)\].
5. Under \[Select Role Services\], expand \[Application Development\], check   CGI  , and proceed to the next  
   ![CGI addition](img/iis/iis_s03.png)  
   Please add other roles (authentication, compression, etc.) as necessary (no additional roles are required for the operation of Exment itself)
7. Under \[Check installation options\], click   Install   and wait for the installation to complete.
8. Once the installation is complete, start your browser (such as Internet Explorer) and verify that you can view the IIS default page by accessing http://localhost

> When installing on Windows 10, go to Control Panel - Programs - Programs and Features - Turn Windows features on or off and select Internet Information Services. 1_, and enable   CGI   in \[Application Development Features\].

16. Return to the administrator command prompt and run the following command to initialize MySQL
    ```
    mysql_secure_installation
    ```
    1. You will be asked "Enter password for user root:", so enter the initial password you wrote down and press Enter.
    2. "The existing password for the user account root has expired. Please set a new password." is displayed  
       You will be asked for a new password, "New password:", so enter your new password and press Enter. You will be asked "Re-enter new password:", so enter your new password again and press Enter.

<!-- Please check the following steps -->

15. Set folder permissions so that it can be written to from Laravel
    Give the IIS execution user (IIS_IUSRS) write permissions to the folder where you expanded the ZIP in Exment and configured the virtual directory.  
    > C:\exment in the example
    
    ![Open folder](img/iis/iis_s19.png)

    ![Edit permissions](img/iis/iis_s20.png)
    7. Click \[OK\] twice to close properties

<!--
It seems that IIS_IUSRS write permission is actually required not only for the storage folder but also for other files and folders in the exment folder.
Since I don't know what minimum permissions are actually required for which resources, in the test environment I have given IIS_IUSRS write permissions to the entire C:\exment folder to confirm that the Exment web app works. .
Once we know the minimum access rights, we will revise this section accordingly.

14. Set folder permissions so that it can be written to from Laravel
    > Give the IIS execution user (IIS_IUSRS) write permissions to the folder where you expanded the Exment ZIP and configured the virtual directory (for example C:\exment)

## Correspondence when upgrading PHP version
If you want to change the PHP version, please update it by following the steps below.   
â€»Exment will not be accessible while the version is being upgraded.   
â€»The example below is the procedure for updating from PHP7.4 to PHP8.2.   
â€»The version upgrade method may differ depending on the environment, installation time, version, and installation method.   

- Stop IIS in preparation for work.   

- Back up the PHP execution folder you are currently using. You can rename the folder, copy it to another location, or do whatever you like.   

- Download new PHP.   

   1. Access https://windows.php.net/download/
   2. Download the \[VC15 x64 Non Thread Safe\] ZIP file for \[PHP 8.2\]  
      > If you are using a 32-bit version of Windows in a Windows 10 environment, please download the \[VC15 x86 Non Thread Safe \] ZIP file.
   3. Extract the contents of the ZIP file to the same path as the previous PHP.   
   â€» It is assumed that PATH is set in the environment variable.   

- Copy the php.ini file from the previous version's PHP folder that you have backed up to the new version's PHP folder.   

- Edit the php.ini file as required.   
   1. If the GD library in the "Dynamic Extension" section is commented out, enable it.
        ```
        ;extension=gd
        ```
        Change as belows (Remove the ; from the beginning of the line to uncomment it)
        ```
        extension=gd
        ```

   â€» Depending on the original PHP version, extension=gd2 may be set. Please change extension=gd.   

- Start IIS.   

- Check that the PHP version is 8.2.X using a command prompt, etc.   

~~~
php -v
~~~
