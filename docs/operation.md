# Data update settings
A specific trigger such as "click a button" or "create new data" updates the data saved in Exment in a batch.  
As an example, it can be used for the following purposes.  

- Display the "Finish" button on the data details screen of the table "Task Information" and click the button to complete the value of the custom column "Status".  
- When updating data, the value of the custom column "person in charge" is automatically set for the logged-in user.  


> This function was implemented as "Batch data update" in v3.5.0 and below. The function has been expanded from v3.5.0.  

If you want to update more complicated conditions or more complicated contents, implement [Plug-in (button)](/plugin_quickstart_button) or [Plug-in (event)](/plugin_quickstart_event). Please give me.
