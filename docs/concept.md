# Exment concept
Exment is a "Web database that can manage anything".  
By adding the content you want to manage to the Exment system, you can take on various roles.  
  
This can be easily understood by comparing with Excel.  
If you create a new file in Excel, an empty sheet will be displayed. At this point, the Excel file has no role.
